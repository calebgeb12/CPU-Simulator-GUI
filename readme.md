1) This repo is a fork of the starter code repo, but an independent console-based solution is implemented

2) The solution is coded in Java, and it can be found by going to .testing/Testing.java

3) This ./testing folder contains all of the scheduling algorithms in different classes. The Testing.java class uses these classes to test data.

4) Simply use your desired terminal environment to run this .testing class. After running, you are not required to input any information as all test data is hard coded

5) To use personalized test data, you can modify the data structures and variables in the main method
